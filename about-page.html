            <p id="sometext"> hello! welcome to my personal website. I made
                this website to replicate some of my favorite carrd pages.
                carrd is a website where you can basically make free websites with a limites number of icons. I used to
                be
                really active on kpop stan twitter and so I made a lot of different types of carrd when I was younger. I
                was
                always facisnated how people would make theres look so cool. I have provided examples of some of the
                carrds
                that I have made. I wanted to try to replicate some of these carrds using html and css. The images I
                used for my main icons are all from pinterest. </p>
