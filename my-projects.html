            <p id="explain-text"> The first project I made was with codepath. I took the Intro to Web Development Course
                during the fall
                of 2023. Through this course, I made an informational website about banned books. The website gives a
                brief history of banned books, explains the importance of books and reading banned books, and in
                addition, current news about banned books and even an petition. I used html, css and javascript to make
                this website. This website is still a work in progress and will continue to be updated.

                website you are
                looking at. I made this website using html and css. In the future, I plan on using javascript and even a
                programming language (java or python) to make improvements to my website.

            <p id="explain-text"> During the fall of 2023, I made a website with a group of classmates for our Software
                Design class. This
                website allows users to explore interesting statistics about a country. The data we used was provided by
                the World Bank Financial Data adn this website explores some of the data provided. These statistics
                include, the population, percentage with internet access, percentage of country that is employed and
                more
                comparisons. The group effort led to the creation and exploration of this This
                website was made using python, SQL, Flask, and basic HTML and CSS.
